# BossFight

One-page design document.

## Game Identity / Mantra: 

Hardcore Rogue-like Action RPG set in a grim and desolate nightmare realm, in which the player faces a neverending stream of ever more horrifying and dangerous boss monsters.

## Design Pillars:

*Desolation*

*Kafkaesque*

*Survival*

## Genre/Story/Mechanics Summary:

This game consists solely of **procedurally generated boss levels**, each of which poses a different hostile environment inhabited by an exceedingly powerful entity, that will meet the player with either indifference, predatorial instinct, sadism, hatred or utter strangeness. This only ends when the player character dies, in which case the character and all progress is permantly and irreversibly lost.

The setting is one of **dark fantasy** in which man-made objects range from primitive to medieval and where there are many other objects of **weird alien technology** with seemingly random but powerful properties, whose use almost always comes at a terrible price.

After a boss has been defeated in skill-based **real-time combat** the player can safely wander the level, loot and on rare occasions interact with a non-hostile NPC, until the player enters the dominion of the next boss. Before entering the new level, you can invite friends to enter the level with you in **coop-mode**.

*The game tells the story of a meaningless and torturous existence in an incomprehensible hateful world that wants to kill you.*

## Unique Features:

### Deep Reinforcement Learning
Deep Q Learning algorithms enable the enemy agents to adapt to the players behaviour and constantly enhance their action policy during a boss fight, making them harder to beat with every learning cycle.

### Procedural Generation and Emergent Storytelling
Levels, Bosses, NPCs, Items and powers are procedurally generated. Generative machine learning algorithms and semantic labels are used to generate consistent themes and emergent storylines/backgrounds for each boss level.

## Interface: 

The combat system is based on timing, tactics and maneouvering and requires the player to actively block, strike, dodge or trigger special abilities using either a **controller** or **mouse+keyboard**.

The GUI is minimalistic and non-invasive.

## Art Style:
